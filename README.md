# IronJS

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/johanstenberg92/IronJS.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/johanstenberg92/IronJS)

## Introduction
IronJS aims to run Javascript on the CLR using the Dynamic Language Runtime.

This project is, for now, meant to only be a toy/learning project - the "wheel"
is re-invented multiple times. If looking for inspiration for your own compiler project,
please browse the source code and the accompaying tests for inspiration. You could also
take a look at a "compiler-compiler" such as ANTLR to automagically generate a scanner,
lexer and parser for your grammar instead.
